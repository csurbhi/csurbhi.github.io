<p>Hi!I am Surbhi Palande, I am a Ph.D. candidate at University of British Columbia, Vancouver.
I am super lucky to be co-advised by two brilliant advisors: Professor Margo Seltzer and Professor Alexandra Fedorova.</p>

<p>In general I love systems research; I have worked for 10+ years in building systems, largely storage.
Currently I am researching the STL architecture and its placement that allows SMR drives to shine better.
I am also working on making host-based I/O to Zoned Devices more efficient.
In this blog, I plan to write about research on flash, a condensed version of my understanding of PCIe, NVME, ATA
and other stuff that I learn on the go. Hope this helps you in some way :)</p>

<p>My unupdated LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/csurbhi/">here</a>.</p>
