        <h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
        <p>You’ve reached the blog of <strong>Surbhi Palande</strong>. I am a
nobody, if you are here, most likely you already know me. But if you don't
then here is a small introduction! I am a Computer Science Graduate that took
some time to discover her love for systems programming— I only realized this in my third year of engineering. Since graduating, I have worked in storage systems, but for a long time, I focused more on the how rather than the why of design decisions.</p>
        <p>In what some might call a bold move, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. after having two children. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the guidance of two wonderful advisors, to whom I will always be grateful.</p>
        <p>During my Ph.D., I also embarked on a deeply personal journey of spirituality. I rediscovered the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, having previously explored the Jesuit Bible, and found myself drawn to <strong>Vedanta</strong>—a philosophy that embraces all religions and shares similarities with Unitarian beliefs. It was Swami Vivekananda’s lectures that inspired me to explore his teachings, leading me further into this philosophical pursuit.</p>
        <p>In this blog, I write about my two greatest passions: <strong>systems programming</strong> and <strong>mysticism</strong>. Lately, I have also developed a keen interest in relearning calculus, physics, and especially quantum physics—subjects that bring me a sense of peace and excitement.</p>
        <p>I invite you to my Blog <p class="blog-link">here -> <a href="https://csurbhi.github.io/myblog" target="_blank">Visit My Blog</a></p>
