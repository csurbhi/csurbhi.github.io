Hello and welcome!

You’ve reached the blog of Surbhi Palande. I took some time to discover my
love for systems programming—which I only realized in my third year of engineering. Since graduating, I have worked in storage systems, but for a long time, I focused more on the how rather than the why of design decisions.

In what some might call a bold move, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. after having two children. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the guidance of two wonderful advisors, to whom I will always be grateful.

During my Ph.D., I also embarked on a deeply personal journey of spirituality. I rediscovered the Bhagavad Gita, having previously explored the Jesuit Bible, and found myself drawn to Vedanta—a philosophy that embraces all religions and shares similarities with Unitarian beliefs. It was Swami Vivekananda’s lectures that inspired me to explore his teachings, leading me further into this philosophical pursuit.

In this blog, I write about my two greatest passions: systems programming and mysticism. Lately, I have also developed a keen interest in relearning calculus, physics, and especially quantum physics—subjects that bring me a sense of peace and excitement.

I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery!
