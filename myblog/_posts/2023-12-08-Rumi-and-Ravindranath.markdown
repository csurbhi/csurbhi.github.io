        <h2>Rumi - Jalal ad Din Mohammad Balkhi</h2>
        <p>Rumi was born in Balkh that is a part of Afghanistan today. He grew up in a Persian family. His father Baha Al Din Walad was a famous Islamist jurist, theologian, and scholar. Rumi was exposed to Islamic teachings from a very young age. During the Mongol invasion the family had to flee Afghanistan and settle in Konya, Turkey.</p>
        <p>Rumi studied philosophy, Islamic jurisprudence, and spirituality under the guidance of scholars in Konya. His encounter with the wandering dervish Shams al-Din Tabrizi transformed his life. Shams mentored Rumi in a deep understanding of Sufi poetry.</p>
        <p>Rumi wrote over 65,000 verses, mostly compiled in two important collections: the mystical poetry in the Mathnavi or Masnavi, and the Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi dedicated to his beloved mentor Shams al-Din Tabrizi. Rumi founded the Mevlevi order, also known as the Whirling Dervishes, whose hypnotic whirling/spinning dance symbolizes the seeker’s journey to divine reunion.</p>
        <p>Rumi’s philosophy is based on the idea that we are all interconnected and that love is the essence of all existence. He believed that the goal of life is to realize our oneness with God and with all creation.</p>

        <h2>Ravindranath Tagore</h2>
        <p>Ravindranath Tagore was born in May 1861 and wrote poems that expressed a transcendent intimacy with the divine. His acclaimed work “Gitanjali,” translated into English in 1912, earned him the Nobel prize in Literature in 1913. Tagore’s works conveyed the idea of a direct, joyful, and fearless relationship with God, akin to Rumi’s writings.</p>
        <p>Tagore’s family was a confluence of three cultures: Hinduism, Mohammedanism, and British influences. He grew in an atmosphere where deep knowledge of Sanskrit and Hindu texts blended with Islamic and Persian literature. He wrote on a range of topics, including nationalism, poverty, literature, culture, and social change.</p>
        <p>Tagore’s idea of Shantiniketan inspired figures like Leonard Elmhirst and Mushanokōji Saneatsu to set up institutions focused on holistic education.</p>

        <h2>Mystic Poetry</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <h3>Waiting by Ravindranath Tagore:</h3>
            <p>The song I came to sing remains unsung till today!<br>
            I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.<br>
            The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set,<br>
            only there is agony of wishing in my heart....</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <h3>Agony and Ecstasy of Divine Discontent: The Moods of Rumi</h3>
            <p>In the orchard and rose garden I long to see your face,<br>
            In the taste of sweetness I long to kiss your lips.<br>
            In the shadows of passion I long for your love.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <h3>Come to Me: by Rumi</h3>

            Come settle with me, Let us be neighbors to the stars...</p>

            <h3>Behind the Scenes by Rumi</h3>
            <p>Is it your face that adorns this garden?<br>
            Is it your fragrance that intoxicates this garden?<br>
            Is it your spirit that has made this brook a river of wine?</p>

        <h2>Famous Quotes by the Great Rumi</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“I have learned so much from God that I do not look for anything outside of myself. Everything is within me, the entire universe is inside me.”</p>

        <h3>When I Die by Rumi</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When I die, when my coffin is being taken out you must never think I am missing this world...<br>
            When you leave me in the grave, don't say goodbye, remember a grave is only a curtain for the paradise behind.</p>
