Rumi was born as Jalal ad-Din Mohammad Balkhi in Persia on September 30th 1207. 
The poet was known as Rumi based after the city he lived
in. Rumi composed many works of mysticism and expressed the deepest longings
of the human heart for it's beloved divine. Rumi was a mystic, a deep thinker, a sufi poet and all his work quenches the readers thirst to express the divine and find themselves.

Rumi was born in Balkh that is a part of Afghanistan today. He grew up in a Persian family. His father Baha Al Din Walad was a famous Islamist jurist, theologian, and scholar. Rumi was exposed to Islamic teachings from a very young age. During the Mongol ivasion the family had to flee Afghanistan and settle in Konya, Turkey.

Rumi studied philiosophy, Islamic jurisprudence, and spirituality under the guidance of scholars in Konya. His encounter with the wandering dervish (member of the Sufi or Islamic mystic fraternity) Shams al-Din Tabrizi transformed his life. Shams mentored Rumi in a deep understanding of Sufi poetry. 

Rumi wrote over 65000 verses, that mostly spanned into two important collections: the mystical poetry compiled in the Mathnavi or Masnavi and the second one Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi that was dedicated to his beloved mentor Shams al-Din Tabrizi. Rumi founded the Mevlevi order also known as the Whirling Dervishes whose hypnotic whirling/spinning dance symbolizes the seeker's journey to divine reunion.

Rumi influenced many poets that came after, one of them seems to be Ravindranath Tagore who was born nearly 6 centuries later. 

Ravindranath Tagore was born in May 1861 and wrote similar poems that expressed the
transcendent intimacy for the divine. His much acclaimed work "Gitanjali"
translated by Tagore in English (in 1912), earned him the Nobel prize in
Literature in 1913. The idea of a direct, joyful, and totally fearless relationship
with God can be found in many of Tagore’s religious writings, including the poems of Gitanjali.
This is similar to the writings of Rumi in my very humble opinion! Unlike Rumi, Ravindranath Tagore did not meet any enlightened teacher or only write mystical verses or essays. He also wrote about other non mystical matters such as nationalism, poverty, etc.

Ravindranath Tagore's own family was a confluence of three cultures: "Hinduism",
"Mohammedean" and "British". His father Dwarkanath was well known for his
command over "Arabic" and "Persian". Ravindranath grew in an atmosphere in
which a deep knowledge of Sanskrit and ancient Hindu texts was combined with
an understanding of Islamic traditions as well as Persian literature. His
outlook was persistently non sectarian! Most of his work was written in
Shantiniketan (Abode of Peace), the small town that grew around the school he
founded in Bengal in 1901. Tagore was no only a great poet, but he was also a
versatile writer, music composer, painter. He wrote many short stories,
novels, playwrights, essays on politics, literature, culture, social change,
religious beliefs, philosophical analysis, international relations and much
else. He also painted pictures and depicted a mix of representation and
whimsical abstraction.

It is interesting to note that Tagore's idea of Shantiniketan inspired
Leonard Elmhirst to set up Dartington Hall in UK and Mushanokōji Saneatsu to
setup the Little Village in Japan. The idea was to do local changes at the
grassroot level and instil an education system that was wholistic.

We can imagine that Rabindranath’s physical appearance – handsome, bearded,
dressed in non-Western clothes – may, to some extent, have encouraged his
being seen as a carrier of exotic wisdom. Yasunari Kawabata, the first
Japanese Nobel Laureate in Literature, treasured memories from his middle-school
days of “this sage-like poet”:

His white hair flowed softly down both sides of his forehead; the tufts of hair under
the temples also were long like two beards, and linking up with the hair on his cheeks,
continued into his beard, so that he gave an impression, to the boy I was then, of
some ancient Oriental wizard!


Ravindranath Tagore is the only person who has written the
national anthems of two countries: India and Bangladesh. He wrote India's
national anthem "Jana Gana Mana" and Bandladesh's "Amar sonar Bangla".

The poems of both Ravindranath Tagore and Rumi strung a heart's exalted yearning, ravishing ecstacy and
consuming desire! They are as powerful today as they were many years ago!
An ambiguity about religious experience is central to many of Rumi and Tagore’s devotional
poems, and makes them appeal to readers irrespective of their beliefs.
This applies particularly to their many poems which combine images of human love and
those of pious devotion. 

Here, I have compiled some of the poems of both the poets.

--------------
**Waiting by Ravindranath Tagore:**

	The song I came to sing

	Remains unsung till today!

	I have spent my days in stringing

	and in unstringing my instrument.


	The time has not come true,

	the words have not been rightly set,

	only there is agony

	of whishing in my heart....


	I have not seen his face,

	nor have I listened to his voice,

	only I have heard his gentle footsteps

	from the road before my house...


	But the lamp has not been lit

	And I cannot ask him into my house;

	I live in the hope of meeting with him;

	but this meeting is not yet!



-------------------


**Agony and Ecstasy of Divine Discontent: The Moods of Rumi**


	In the orchard and rose garden

	I long to see your face

	In the taste of sweetness

	I long to kiss your lips.

	In the shadows of passion

	I long for your love.



	Oh! Supreme lover!

	Let me leave aside my worries.

	The flowers are blooming

	with the exultation of your Spirit.



	By Allah!

	I long to escape the prison of my ego

	and lose myself in the mountains and the desert.


	These sad and lonely people tire me.

	I long to revel in the drunken frenzy of your love

	and feel the strength of Rustom in my hands.


	I am sick of mortal kings

	I long to see your light!

	With lamps in hand

	the sheikhs and mullahs roam

	the dark alleys of these towns

	not finding what they seek.

	Your are the Essence of the Essence,

	The intoxication of Love,

	I long to sing your praises

	but stand mute

	with the agony of wishing in my heart!


*This poem is Rumi's earnest request to unite with God!! How beautiful it is.
It is so wonderful that after all these years, the poem brings peace to the
reader!!*



**Come to Me: by Rumi**

	I am your lover

	Come to my side

	I will open

	the gate to your love

	Come settle with me

	Let us be neighbors

	to the stars

	You have been hiding so long

	aimlessly drifting

	in the sea of my love.

	Even so

	you have always been

	connected to me

	Concealed, revealed

	in the known

	in the unmanifest

	I am life itself.

	You have been a prisoner

	of a little pond

	I am the ocean

	and its turbulent flood

	Come merge with me

	leave this world of ignorance

	Be with me

	I will open

	the gate to your love.


**Behind the scenes by Rumi:**

	Is it your face

	that adorns this garden?
	
	Is it your fragrance

	that intoxicates this garden?
	
	Is it your spirit

	that has made this brook
	
	a river of wine?
		

	Hundereds have looked for you	

	and died searching
	
	in this garden
	
	where you hide behind the scenes.

	But this pain is not for those

	who come as lovers.
		
	You are easy to find here.

	You are in the breeze

	and in this river of wine


**HAVE YOU NOT HEARD HIS SILENT STEPS?**
Here is a poem by Ravindranath Tagore, that I love a lot! I learnt this as a
child, at my school. I was startled to learn a song about God that was so
simple and that evoked surrendering or seeing God everywhere!
So beautiful <3 



	HAVE you not heard his silent, steps?

	He comes, comes, ever comes.

	Every moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes.


	Many a song have I sung in many a mood of mind, 

	but all their notes have always proclaimed, 

	He comes, comes, ever comes.
	

	In the fragrant days of sunny April

 	through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes.
 	 

	In the rainy gloom of July nights

	on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes.

	
	In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps

	that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch

	of his feet that makes my joy to shine.
