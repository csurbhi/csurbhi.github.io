Does pain stop when you can take no more?  
Does success arrive when failure’s avalanche cuts to your core?  

Does happiness return when into a million pieces is shattered your heart?  
Does peace finally appear to soothe your weary path?

No! What comes is often orthogonal — far beyond your control.  
But what you allow yourself to feel can slowly make you whole.  

Life may not always be fair,  
Yet self-pity is a burden you cannot wear.

Peace is always inward, the refuge of the romantic;  
For only one who loves living can truly be idealistic.  

And just as a baby is soothed only by its mother,  
I pray to find grace, love, and bliss in God — and no other.
