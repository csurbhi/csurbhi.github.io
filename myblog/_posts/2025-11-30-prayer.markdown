<h2>
Does pain stop when you can take no more?
Does success arrive when failure’s avalanche cuts to your core?
Does happiness return when into a million pieces is shattered your heart?
Does peace finally appear to soothe your weary path?

No! What comes is often orthogonal — far beyond your control.
But what you allow yourself to feel can slowly make you whole.
Life may not always be fair,
Yet self-pity is a burden you cannot wear.

Peace is always inward, the refuge of the romantic;
For only one who loves living can truly be idealistic.
And just as a baby is soothed only by its mother,
I pray to find grace, love, and bliss in God — and no other.
